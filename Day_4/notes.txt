When you create a module inside your Python folder, the __pycache__ folder is generated automatically. This folder stores the compiled bytecode of your Python files. Hereâ€™s why this happens:

Bytecode Compilation: When you run a Python script or import a module, Python compiles your source code into bytecode, which is a lower-level, platform-independent representation of your code1.
Faster Imports: Storing this bytecode in the __pycache__ folder allows Python to load modules faster in subsequent runs, as it can skip the compilation step if the bytecode is already available and up-to-date1.
Automatic Creation: If the __pycache__ folder doesnâ€™t exist, Python will create it the first time you run your script or import a module1.
You can safely delete the __pycache__ folder if needed; it will be recreated the next time you run your script or import a module 

Qus. Difference btw Bytecode and Binary Code?

Ans.=>   Bytecode
Intermediate Code: Bytecode is an intermediate code between the source code and machine code. It is not directly executed by the hardware but by a virtual machine (VM).
Platform-Independent: Bytecode is designed to be platform-independent, meaning it can run on any system that has the appropriate virtual machine. For example, Java bytecode runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Interpretation: Bytecode is interpreted or compiled just-in-time (JIT) by the virtual machine into machine code that the processor can execute.
Examples: Java bytecode, Python bytecode.

=>Binary Code
Machine Code: Binary code, also known as machine code, is the lowest-level code that is directly executed by the computerâ€™s processor.
Platform-Specific: Binary code is specific to the architecture of the processor it was compiled for. It cannot be easily transferred between different types of systems.
Direct Execution: Binary code is directly executed by the CPU without the need for interpretation by a virtual machine.
Examples: Executable files like .exe on Windows, compiled binaries on Linux.

=>Key Differences
Execution: Bytecode requires a virtual machine for execution, while binary code is executed directly by the processor.
Portability: Bytecode is portable across different platforms, whereas binary code is specific to a particular hardware architecture.
Performance: Binary code generally offers faster execution since it runs directly on the hardware, while bytecode may have some overhead due to interpretation or JIT compilation



->append vs extend
ğŸ”¹ append(): Adds a single item to the end of the list
- It treats the argument as one object, regardless of its type.
- The entire object is added as a single element.

ğŸ”¸ extend(): Adds each element of an iterable to the list
- It iterates over the argument and adds each item individually.
- Only works with iterables (like lists, tuples, strings).
