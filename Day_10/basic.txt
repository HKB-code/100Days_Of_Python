1.Docstrings are basically a way for us to create little bits of documentation as we're coding along

in our functions, or in our other blocks of code.The docstring has to go as the first line after the declaration.

So here we've defined the name of our function the inputs.

And then after the colon the first indented line will be the docstring.

But that's not it,

you also have to use three of these quotation marks, and it's in between these three quotation marks

that you can write your documentation.

We could write something like, well, what is this format name function going to do?

What would we want our future selves or another user who's using this function to know about it?

2.Using the dict() Constructor
You can initialize a dictionary with key-value pairs using the dict() constructor.
# Create an empty dictionary
empty_dict = dict()

# Add key-value pairs
empty_dict["name"] = "John"
empty_dict["age"] = 30
empty_dict["city"] = "New York"

print(empty_dict)
