When you use the * operator with a list in Python, it creates a new list by repeating the original list a specified number of times. This new list is separate from the original list.
original_list = ["_"]
new_list = original_list * 5
print(new_list)  # Output: ["_", "_", "_", "_", "_"]
print(original_list)  # Output: ["_"]
